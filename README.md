I am Omkar Bhagwat, Computational Design and Construction student. Passionate about programming and has eager to learn more.
I'm fascinated by Nature based solutions and want to implicate such strategies in product design and architecture. 

I'm experince user of Rhino and Grasshopper and have started programming in c# from the beginning of year 2018. All my work in this repository contains extensive use of RhinoCommon and Grasshopper API.
